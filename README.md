Something I find interesting is video games. This is the closest I can get without going over 1000 lines.

FILE EXPLANATIONS:

  main.cpp    -  Contains the majority of the code for the project

  asciiArt.h  -  Contains all of the art and animations for the program

  funValue.h  -  Contains the definitions for secret names (namely hard and easy mode)

I would personally suggest testing the program once for yourself before viewing the code, but do what you want.
