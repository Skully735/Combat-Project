  Something I find interesting is video games. This is the closest I can get without going over 1000 lines. Inspired by RPG battle systems like Mother 1 and Earthbound, Dragon Quest I and Dragon Quest II, and Undertale and Deltarune, this project features one major boss battle. ASCII art was used to add visuals (which was difficult when trying to avoid unicode) and an extreme amount of 'cout' and 'sleep_for()' in order to add animations. 
  
  The battle has an enemy with two different attacks, while you have five different actions to choose from. You start with 300 Health Points (HP) and 120 Magic Points (MP), and you have to use your various options to win. However, don't expect the boss to be fair either. Well hero? Good luck!

FILE EXPLANATIONS:

  main.cpp    -  Contains the majority of the code for the project

  asciiArt.h  -  Contains all of the art and animations for the program

  funValue.h  -  Contains the definitions for secret names (namely hard and easy mode)

I would personally suggest testing the program once for yourself before viewing the code, but do what you want
